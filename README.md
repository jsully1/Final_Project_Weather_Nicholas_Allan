Ten minute plan 


The goals of this project are to find what variables in weather interact with each other and hopefully to create weather simulator that will be able to accurately predict one of the 6 measured variables. These variables that I am using in this project are temperature, relative humidity, rainfall , wind direction, wind speed,  gust speed. To do this I am seeking to find trends between these variables. This means if one variable spikes does it affect the other variables in a repeatable pattern.  Once these trends are found I would like to use statistical analysis to calculate possible mathematical tends or equations that can begin predicting outcomes.  This will create the basses of my weather simulator and hopefully will lead me to  a more accurate answer. 


For now in my ipythone notebook I have created graphs showing visual data about the variables. I plotted every single variable along side a temperature graph.  I did this because I decided that I should focus on trying to predict one variable before creating a simulator that can predict any variable.  These sides by side graphs give a good visual key to see which variable react in the same way or at the same time. 


im having issues with the script that is named as Graph_maker.py in the bin directory. the issue is that i can not get the script to save the figures after running the plot aspect of the program. i think the problem lies with my loop that i created so that i could create graphs automatically in stead of activity writing the code for each graph. 

Another aspect of my code that I would like someoneâ€™s opinion on is the efficiency of my code. Where can I add functions or loop so that I limit my code being repeated.
